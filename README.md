Hi,

If you use Dism ADK11, you have probably got an 0xc1510114 specific error.
To resolve it, you must inject all commands in the same cmd session (file TestCmdADK11V2.zip).
You can reproduce this specific error 0xc1510114 with use TestCmdADK11.zip file (it use asynchrone task).

Thanks and regards.
